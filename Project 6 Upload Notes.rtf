\f0\fs24 \cf0 Cannot take picture to test camera functionality on simulator as I lack a real device for testing. However, camera implementation seems to work, as it is possible to access the camera interface, toggle flash setting between on/auto/off and other possible things. Also, unique pictures are used from photo album and shared through the app, assuming this is a required feature as mentioned on the project 6 page via CodePath, even though the unique picture sharing is not mentioned in the readme.\

Partial implementation of the stretch feature for viewing and posting comments was implemented, however, only the code in files, and the respective swift file for CommentsViewController have completed code, although, it is unused. I am unsure if partial points are given for any of this.}
